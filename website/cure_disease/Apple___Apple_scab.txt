Apple scab is a fungal disease that affects apple trees, causing black or olive-green lesions on the leaves, fruit, and twigs. Here are some steps to treat and prevent apple scab disease:

1. Remove infected leaves and fruit: Remove all fallen leaves and fruit from around the tree, and prune any infected twigs or branches. This will help reduce the amount of fungal spores that can spread to healthy trees.

2. Use fungicides: Apply fungicides in early spring before the leaves emerge to prevent apple scab. You can also apply fungicides during the growing season if the disease is already present.

3. Choose resistant varieties: Consider planting apple tree varieties that are resistant to apple scab, such as Liberty, Enterprise, or Freedom.

4. Improve air circulation: Prune the tree to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves and fruit.

5. Keep the area clean: Remove any debris, weeds, or grass from around the base of the tree to keep the area clean and reduce fungal spores.

6. Water properly: Water the tree deeply and regularly, but avoid overhead watering as this can spread fungal spores.
