Apple black rot is a fungal disease that affects apple trees, causing brown to black circular lesions on the fruit and leaves, as well as twig cankers. Here are some steps to treat and prevent apple black rot disease:

1. Remove infected plant material: Remove any infected fruit, leaves, and twigs from the tree and the ground around it. This will help reduce the amount of fungal spores that can spread to healthy trees.

2. Use fungicides: Apply fungicides in early spring before the leaves emerge to prevent apple black rot. You can also apply fungicides during the growing season if the disease is already present.

3. Improve air circulation: Prune the tree to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves and fruit.

4. Keep the area clean: Remove any debris, weeds, or grass from around the base of the tree to keep the area clean and reduce fungal spores.

5. Water properly: Water the tree deeply and regularly, but avoid overhead watering as this can spread fungal spores.

6. Choose resistant varieties: Consider planting apple tree varieties that are resistant to apple black rot, such as Braeburn, Granny Smith, or Honeycrisp.
