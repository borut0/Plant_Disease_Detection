Cedar apple rust is a fungal disease that affects apple trees, causing yellow-orange spots on the leaves and fruit, as well as galls on the twigs. Here are some steps to treat and prevent cedar apple rust disease:

1. Remove infected plant material: Remove any infected fruit, leaves, and twigs from the tree and the ground around it. This will help reduce the amount of fungal spores that can spread to healthy trees.

2. Use fungicides: Apply fungicides in early spring before the leaves emerge to prevent cedar apple rust. You can also apply fungicides during the growing season if the disease is already present.

3. Improve air circulation: Prune the tree to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves and fruit.

4. Keep the area clean: Remove any debris, weeds, or grass from around the base of the tree to keep the area clean and reduce fungal spores.

5. Choose resistant varieties: Consider planting apple tree varieties that are resistant to cedar apple rust, such as Rome, Cortland, or Empire.

6. Use physical barriers: Place physical barriers such as plastic or cloth over the trees during the cedar apple rust spore release season (usually from mid-spring to early summer) to prevent fungal spores from reaching the tree.
