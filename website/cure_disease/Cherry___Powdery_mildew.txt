Cherry powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects cherry trees, causing white powdery spots on the leaves and fruit, which can eventually cause the leaves to yellow and drop off. Here are some steps to treat and prevent cherry powdery mildew:

1. Remove infected plant material: Remove any infected leaves, fruit, and twigs from the tree and the ground around it. This will help reduce the amount of fungal spores that can spread to healthy trees.

2. Use fungicides: Apply fungicides in early spring before the leaves emerge to prevent cherry powdery mildew. You can also apply fungicides during the growing season if the disease is already present.

3. Improve air circulation: Prune the tree to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves and fruit.

4. Keep the area clean: Remove any debris, weeds, or grass from around the base of the tree to keep the area clean and reduce fungal spores.

5. Water properly: Water the tree deeply and regularly, but avoid overhead watering as this can promote fungal growth.

6. Choose resistant varieties: Consider planting cherry tree varieties that are resistant to powdery mildew, such as Stella, Lapins, or Rainier.
