Cercospora leaf spot and gray leaf spot are two fungal diseases that can affect corn plants, causing brown to grayish-brown spots on the leaves, which can lead to premature death of the leaves and a reduction in yield. Here are some steps to treat and prevent these diseases:

1. Crop rotation: Avoid planting corn in the same area for at least two years. This will help reduce the amount of fungal spores that can spread to healthy plants.

2. Remove infected plant material: Remove any infected leaves and stalks from the field, and avoid leaving crop residue on the ground after harvest.

3. Use fungicides: Apply fungicides to the corn plants in the early stages of growth, and continue to apply them at regular intervals as directed by the manufacturer.

4. Plant resistant varieties: Choose corn varieties that are resistant to cercospora leaf spot and gray leaf spot, as these can help reduce the incidence of these diseases.

5. Improve air circulation: Plant corn in rows, with adequate spacing between the plants, to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves.

6. Water properly: Avoid overhead watering and instead water at the base of the plants. This will help prevent the spread of fungal spores.
