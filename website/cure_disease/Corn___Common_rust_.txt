Common rust is a fungal disease that affects corn plants, causing small, circular to elongated orange or rusty-brown pustules on the leaves, which can lead to a reduction in yield. Here are some steps to treat and prevent corn common rust:

1. Crop rotation: Avoid planting corn in the same area for at least two years. This will help reduce the amount of fungal spores that can spread to healthy plants.

2. Remove infected plant material: Remove any infected leaves and stalks from the field, and avoid leaving crop residue on the ground after harvest.

3. Use fungicides: Apply fungicides to the corn plants in the early stages of growth, and continue to apply them at regular intervals as directed by the manufacturer.

4. Plant resistant varieties: Choose corn varieties that are resistant to common rust, as these can help reduce the incidence of the disease.

5. Improve air circulation: Plant corn in rows, with adequate spacing between the plants, to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves.

6. Monitor weather conditions: Common rust thrives in warm, humid weather conditions. If you know that the weather is going to be warm and humid, be prepared to spray fungicides as needed.
