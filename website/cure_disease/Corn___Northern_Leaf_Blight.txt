Corn northern leaf blight is a fungal disease that can cause significant damage to corn crops. Here are some steps you can take to treat corn northern leaf blight:

1. Use fungicides: Fungicides can be an effective way to control the spread of northern leaf blight. There are a number of fungicides available that can be applied to corn plants to help prevent the disease from spreading. Consult with a professional agricultural extension agent or a licensed pesticide applicator for advice on the most effective fungicides for your specific location and situation.

2. Practice crop rotation: Crop rotation can help prevent the buildup of the fungus that causes northern leaf blight in the soil. Consider planting non-host crops in the affected area for a few years before planting corn again.

3. Till and remove crop debris: Remove and destroy any infected plant debris after the harvest season, and till the soil to help break up any remaining plant debris.

4. Maintain good plant nutrition: Providing corn plants with adequate nutrition, especially nitrogen, can help reduce the severity of northern leaf blight.

5. Plant resistant varieties: Consider planting corn varieties that are resistant to northern leaf blight.

6. Monitor your crops: Regularly inspect your corn crops for symptoms of northern leaf blight, such as lesions on the leaves. Early detection and intervention can help prevent the disease from spreading and causing significant damage.
