Tomato late blight is a serious fungal disease caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans. The disease can cause rapid browning and decay of tomato leaves, stems, and fruit, leading to reduced plant growth and productivity. Here are some steps to treat and prevent tomato late blight:

1. Remove infected plant material: Remove any infected leaves, stems, or fruit from the tomato plant and the ground around it. This will help reduce the amount of fungal spores that can spread to healthy plants.

2. Use fungicides: Apply fungicides to the tomato plants preventatively, as directed by the manufacturer. Some effective fungicides for late blight include chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and copper-based fungicides. However, it's important to note that once the disease has taken hold, fungicides may not be effective in controlling it.

3. Properly space the plants: Provide adequate spacing between the tomato plants to promote air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves.

4. Water properly: Water the plants deeply and regularly, but avoid overhead watering as this can promote fungal growth. Instead, use a drip irrigation system or water at the base of the plants.

5. Apply mulch: Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base of the plants to help retain soil moisture and reduce the likelihood of spores splashing onto the lower leaves.

6. Monitor soil fertility: Maintain proper soil fertility and pH levels to help keep tomato plants healthy and more resistant to late blight.

7. Plant resistant varieties: Consider planting tomato varieties that are resistant to late blight.
