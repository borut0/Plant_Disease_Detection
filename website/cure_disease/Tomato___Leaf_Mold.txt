Tomato leaf mold is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen Fulvia fulva. The disease can cause yellowing and browning of the leaves, as well as the appearance of fuzzy white or gray mold on the undersides of the leaves. Here are some steps to treat and prevent tomato leaf mold:

1. Remove infected plant material: Remove any infected leaves or stems from the tomato plant and the ground around it. This will help reduce the amount of fungal spores that can spread to healthy plants.

2. Provide good air circulation: Properly space the tomato plants to promote air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves.

3. Water properly: Water the plants deeply and regularly, but avoid overhead watering as this can promote fungal growth. Instead, use a drip irrigation system or water at the base of the plants.

4. Apply fungicides: Apply fungicides preventatively, as directed by the manufacturer. Some effective fungicides for tomato leaf mold include copper-based fungicides and chlorothalonil.

5. Apply organic mulch: Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base of the plants to help retain soil moisture and reduce the likelihood of spores splashing onto the lower leaves.

6. Monitor soil fertility: Maintain proper soil fertility and pH levels to help keep tomato plants healthy and more resistant to leaf mold.

7. Plant resistant varieties: Consider planting tomato varieties that are resistant to leaf mold.
